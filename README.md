# Blackjack
Rules:
  For the game of blackjack the cards ranks each have their own value ranging from 1-11. 
  Aces can be worth 1 or 11. If your score is below 10 it is valued at 11 but if it is above 10 it is valued at 1.
  Face cards are all valued at 10.
  The rest of the cards are valued based on the pip value of the card.
  The game of blackjack is usually played with rotating dealers.
  The main goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, but without going over 21.
Gameplay:
  At the start of the game, one card is given to each player face up by the dealer then one for the dealer themselves.
  This is repeated again but this time the card for the dealer is face down while the rest are face up.
  After this players have to decide if they would like to stand or hit.
  Stand is where an extra card is not given and hit is when a extra card is handed out to the player.
  The player can keep going until they decide to stand if their card value is 21 or below or it is a bust and the player loses as they   ended up getting more than 21 points and the dealer wins.
  The dealer reveals the faced down card after giving everyone cards and if the value is 17 or higher they must stand but if the value   is 16 or lower they must take a card. The dealer goes on till they have 17 or more. 
  Whoever is closest to 21 at the end without going over wins.
